==============

Small but useful shell scripts.

* **kickstart** is a tool to initialise an SVN repository for a new project. It creates a skeleton, checks it in, and checks out trunk into a new folder for you: `kickstart myproj "example project"` will create a new folder `myproj` with a trunk checkout. Edit the script to set your own repository location. I am aware of the irony of hosting this on github.
